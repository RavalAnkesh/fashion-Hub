## Project Structure

Here’s a rough layout of the repository:

```
fashion-Hub/
├── backend/           # Backend API code
├── frontend/          # Frontend user-facing app
├── frontend1/         # Maybe alternate frontend / test version?
├── package.json       # Main node package info
├── ... other config files
```

You’ll also see `node_modules/`, lock files etc.

## Getting Started

To set up the project locally:

### Prerequisites

* Node.js & npm (or yarn) installed
* Database setup (if needed)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RavalAnkesh/fashion-Hub.git
   cd fashion-Hub
   ```

2. Backend setup

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   # possibly configure environment variables: DB connection, secret keys, etc.
   ```

3. Frontend setup

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   # adjust config (API endpoint) if needed
   ```

   If you use `frontend1` as alternate version or test branch, similar steps apply.

---

## Usage

* Start backend server:

  ```bash
  cd backend
  npm start
  ```

* Start frontend:

  ```bash
  cd ../frontend
  npm start
  ```

* Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000` (or whichever port) and use the app.

---

## Scripts

List of useful npm scripts (adjust based on what's in package.json):

* `npm start` — runs the server / frontend in production mode
* `npm run dev` — runs in development mode with hot reload (if configured)
* `npm test` — run tests (if implemented)

---

## Deployment

* Build frontend assets (e.g. `npm run build`)
* Ensure backend is production-safe (proper env vars, secure configs)
* Deploy backend & frontend (e.g., via services like Heroku, AWS, Netlify, Vercel)
* Set correct API endpoints in frontend for production
